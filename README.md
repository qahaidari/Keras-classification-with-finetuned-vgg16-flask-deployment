Implementation of a classification neural network in TensorFlow/Keras by fine-tuning VGG16 model and its deployment to Flask web service

# About VGG16 neural network model
VGG16 [1] is a deep convolutional neural network which was trained on a subset of ImageNet dataset and achieves a 92.7% test accuracy.

# About ImageNet dataset
ImageNet is a dataset with over 14 million images from roughly 22000 different classes. VGG16 neural network was trained on around 1.2 million training images consisting of 1000 image classes with 1000 images in each class, 50,000 validation images, and 150,000 testing images. All the images in ImageNet have a fixed resolution of 256 &#x
